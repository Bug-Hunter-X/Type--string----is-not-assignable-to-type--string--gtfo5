This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function `greeter` that takes a string as an argument and returns a greeting. However, when the program attempts to call the `greeter` function with an array of strings, it causes a type error. This is because the `greeter` function expects a single string argument, but the program is providing an array of strings. The solution to this problem is to modify the `greeter` function to accept an array of strings as an argument, or to modify the program to provide the `greeter` function with a single string argument.
